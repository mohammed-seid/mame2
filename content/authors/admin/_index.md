I am a Senior Researcher at Frontieri Consult where I work on writing research and consultancy proposals, design research methodologies, and produce quality research report. I love making beautiful charts, the statistical programming language R and black coffee. 

I studied Development Economics, finishing my PhD in 2021. I worked in academia (teaching and doing research) before moving into consultancy.
